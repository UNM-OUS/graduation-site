<h1>Departmental Convocations</h1>
<p>
    The <a href="<?php echo new URL('/'); ?>">main UNM Commencement ceremony</a> is held at the end of the Spring and Fall semesters.
    UNM graduates from all levels of every school and college are invited to attend.
    Commencements are very large events, with thousands of students and guests attending, and can last as long as two to three hours.
    Because of this they are long, and there isn't time to offer a great deal of individual recognition for students.
</p>
<p>
    Many schools, colleges, departments, and programs also hold their own departmental convocations.
    Convocations are generally much smaller, and can give departments a chance to provide more individual recognition of their graduates in a more personal atmosphere.
