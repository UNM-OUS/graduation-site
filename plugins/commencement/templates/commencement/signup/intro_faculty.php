    Full academic regalia is required for faculty attending Commencement.
    If you order regalia and attend Commencement your regalia rental fees will be covered by the Office of the University Secretary.
    You are free to wear your rental regalia to departmental convocations as well, but note that if you do not check in at Commencement your regalia rental (about $70 for a full set of regalia) will be charged to any convocations you attend.
    Regalia rentals will be available for you to pick up at the bookstore roughly a week before Commencement.
    Platform members' and VIP's regalia will be waiting for you at the event.
    If you order regalia you will receive email communications in the weeks leading up to the event regarding your regalia pickup times and locations.
